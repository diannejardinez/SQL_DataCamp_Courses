-- Filtering using scalar subqueries
-- 01. Generate a list of matches where the total goals scored (for both teams in total) is more than 3 times the average for games in the matches_2013_2014 table, which includes all games played in the 2013/2014 season.
-- Select the average of home + away goals, multiplied by 3
SELECT 
	3 * AVG(home_goal + away_goal)
FROM matches_2013_2014;

SELECT 
	-- Select the date, home goals, and away goals scored
    date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal
FROM  matches_2013_2014
-- Filter for matches where total goals exceeds 3x the average
WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) > 
       (SELECT 3 * AVG(home_goal + away_goal)
        FROM matches_2013_2014); 




 -- Filtering using a subquery with a list
 -- 02. generate a list of teams that never played a game in their home city.
 SELECT 
	-- Select the team long and short names
	team_long_name,
	team_short_name
FROM team 
-- Exclude all values from the subquery
WHERE team_api_id NOT IN 
     (SELECT DISTINCT hometeam_ID  FROM match);




-- Filtering with more complex subquery conditions
-- 03. creating a list of teams that scored 8 or more goals in a home match.
SELECT
	-- Select the team long and short names
	team_long_name,
	team_short_name
FROM team
-- Filter for teams with 8 or more home goals
WHERE team_api_id IN
	  (SELECT hometeam_ID 
       FROM match
       WHERE home_goal >= 8);




-- Joining Subqueries in FROM
-- 04. Generate a subquery using the match table, and then join that subquery to the country table to calculate information about matches with 10 or more goals in total
SELECT 
	-- Select the country ID and match ID
	country_id, 
    id 
FROM match
-- Filter for matches with 10 or more goals in total
WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) >= 10;

SELECT
	-- Select country name and the count match IDs
    c.name AS country_name,
    COUNT(sub.id) AS matches
FROM country AS c
-- Inner join the subquery onto country
-- Select the country id and match id columns
INNER JOIN (SELECT country_id, id 
           FROM match
           -- Filter the subquery by matches with 10+ goals
           WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) >= 10) AS sub
ON c.id = sub.country_id
GROUP BY country_name;




-- Building on Subqueries in FROM
-- 05. Find out some more details about those matches -- when they were played, during which seasons, and how many of the goals were home vs. away goals
SELECT
	-- Select country, date, home, and away goals from the subquery
    country,
    date,
    home_goal,
    away_goal
FROM 
	-- Select country name, date, and total goals in the subquery
	(SELECT c.name AS country, 
     	    m.date, 
     		m.home_goal, 
     		m.away_goal,
           (m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS total_goals
    FROM match AS m
    LEFT JOIN country AS c
    ON m.country_id = c.id) AS subq
-- Filter by total goals scored in the main query
WHERE total_goals >= 10;
